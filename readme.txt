== Description ==

# Description

Nearby creates a table of nearby locations (pages) based on GPS co-ordinates.

Nearby integrates with the following [azurecurve](https://development.azurecurve.co.uk/classicpress-plugins/) plugins:
 * [Flags from azurecurve](https://development.azurecurve.co.uk/classicpress-plugins/flags/) allows a location to be set for a page; this will display the location flag next to the location name in the table of nearby attractions.
 * [Icons from azurecurve](https://development.azurecurve.co.uk/classicpress-plugins/icons/) allows an icon to be displayed next to a nearby location which has an entry on a timeline (requires integration with Timelines to be enabled).
 * [Timelines from azurecurve](https://development.azurecurve.co.uk/classicpress-plugins/timelines/) allows a character (such as *) to be displayed next to a nearby location which has an entry on a timeline.
 * [Toggle Show/Hide from azurecurve](https://development.azurecurve.co.uk/classicpress-plugins/toggle-showhide/) allows the table of nearby locations to be enclosed with a toggle.

Apply the [nearby] shortcode to a page with co-ordinates and nearby locations (pages with co-ordinates), based on the settings, will be displayed in a table.

The shortcode accepts two parameters:
 * **type** to limit nearby attractions (multiple types can be provided in comma separated string)
 * **title** to override the default toggle title

Example shortcode usage: **[nearby type="Distilleries" title="Nearby Distilleries"]**

Examples of this plugin in action:
* [coppr|Distilleries To Visit](https://coppr.uk/distilleries/ireland/northern/killowen/)
* [DarkNexus|Tourist Attractions](https://www.darkforge.co.uk/attractions/europe/republic-of-ireland/east/county-meath/newgrange-monument/)

This plugin is multisite compatible; each site will need settings to be configured in the admin dashboard.
